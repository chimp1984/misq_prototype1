/**
 * Mock protocol for simulating the a basic 2of2 Multisig protocol (MAD). Maker is BTC buyer, Taker is seller. There
 * might be differences for buyer/seller roles which would lead to 4 protocol variations, but we keep it simple and
 * consider there are only 2 roles.
 * <ol>
 *   <li value="1">Maker sends tx inputs.
 *   <li value="3">Maker receives signed 2of MS tx from Taker, signs it and broadcasts it. Wait for confirmation.
 *   <li value="4">After Tx is confirmed she sends funds to Taker and sends Taker a message including her signature for
 *   the payout tx.
 *   <li value="6">After Maker has received Takers message and sees the payout tx in the network she has completed.
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * Taker awaits Maker commitment.
 * <ol>
 *   <li value="2">Taker receives tx inputs of Maker and creates 2of MS tx, signs it and send it back to Maker. Wait for
 *   confirmation once Maker has broadcast tx.
 *   <li value="5">After Taker has received Maker message, checks if he has received the funds and if so he signs the
 *   payout tx and broadcasts it and sends Maker a message that the payout tx is broadcast.
 * </ol>
